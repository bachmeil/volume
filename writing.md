# Does writing really help?

The reason I have this site is to write as much as possible. It doesn't have to be interesting. It doesn't have to be worth reading. It can duplicate in a major way other things I've written. All that's okay.

What I need to do is kick my brain into gear to get it thinking systematically. That doesn't require anything new or interesting. It just requires a topic.

That raises a question. How does one go about getting ideas? We're always thinking about something. Whatever you're thinking about on that day, just write about that. You'll never run out of ideas. There's something on your mind that you can write about.
