<h1 id="too-many-tasks">Too Many Tasks</h1>
<p>First, a little background. This is a “how I work” post. I make no claim to be a productivity guru, and most “productivity” writing (or more accurately, the slice of it that I’ve read over the years) is mostly not interesting and not helpful. I have no idea what will work best for anyone else. This is documentation of how I handle things right now. My work style is constantly evolving so it might be different six months from now.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>I sometimes feel overwhelmed because there are too many things I have to do. What does that actually mean? In the literal sense, it means there are certain tasks that I absolutely have to do on a particular day, and there is not enough time to do them all at the minimum level of quality.</p>
<p>That’s not an accurate description. There’s not a single task that I <em>have to do</em>. If I or a family member had certain medical issues, there would be no choice but to do something, as the consequences would be too great if I didn’t. Another thing I would <em>have to do</em> is take care of a gas leak in my house. There would be no alternative to dropping everything and dealing with a gas leak immediately. I am rarely in the position of having to deal with these tasks.</p>
<p>There are some tasks that would have dramatic consequences not related to health if I didn’t do them. Skipping a work obligation would be a terrible idea. Even if I didn’t get fired, I’d put myself in a bad position, and potentially in line to be fired in the future. Although these tasks exist, they never require more than four hours on any given day, and on most days, far less than that. Tasks with a high cost of failure can’t explain the stress of having too much to do.</p>
<p>So then what does it mean to say I have too much to do? One version is that I’ve <em>committed to doing too many things</em>. That happens from time to time. I agree to do a few things that I don’t have time to do by the deadline without unacceptably intruding in my non-work life. The other version, which is much more common, is that I’ve put too many things on a todo list that is written down or, worse, carried around inside my head. These are things that I feel would have positive value to the world if I were to do them, so I put them on my task list. Many of them are small, and they are not thought out very well, and I won’t enjoy doing them. It creates a lot of stress because there are things on my list I know I can’t and won’t do. The many small tasks cause endless context switching. There’s no plan for how I’m going to complete the tasks, what needs to be done, or how I’m going to get the important stuff done. I jump around chaotically, trying to figure out which task is best to complete in the middle of the workday. That’s the problem I’m expressing when I say “I have too much to do”.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-deal-with-it">How I deal with it</h2>
<p>I used to live in the world of overwhelm. Every single day was filled with stress and chaos and failure. I have some rules that are for the most part sufficient to prevent me from dropping back into that world.</p>
<p>Rule 1: The todo list is for tasks I’ve decided I’m going to do. If it’s something that has positive value to the world, it goes on a different list of things I’ll consider doing if I have time. It’s really easy to implement these lists. If you’re working on paper, leave a few lines at the top for things you know you’re going to do today. Then start another list partway down the page for the other stuff you want to think about later. Once you decide to do one of these other tasks, put a little symbol in front of it. I only worry about the tasks I’ve decided to do, and let the others sit.</p>
<p>Rule 2: The todo list is for things you know you can finish that day. It’s best to put only a few items on the list that you know will take less time than you have available. You can promote other items as desired. If you feel you can’t avoid putting a large number of tasks on the todo list, you need to schedule your day to prove that you have the time. Schedule time generously so you know there’s enough time for each task.</p>
<p>Rule 3: Don’t be afraid to invest time in planning your todo list. This really is the most important time of your day.</p>
<p>Rule 4: It only goes on the todo list if you know exactly what needs to be done. Work time is for working, not for planning what needs to be done. Work hours are too precious to be wasted.</p>
<p>Rule 5: Develop a habit of cutting out things that aren’t sufficiently valuable. Any task you do crowds out other tasks. At any point it time, it’s obvious that many tasks are not valuable enough relative to the others on your list to justify spending time on them. Cross them off or even put them on a “won’t do” list. You can record them elsewhere if you want to revisit them in the future. Get them away from you once you decide to not do them.</p>
<p>Rule 6: You shouldn’t be doing everything that comes into your mind. Most ideas are bad ideas. Failure to do everything you write down is a sign that you’re doing the right things, not a sign of failure. Take pride in your willingness to kill tasks you see as not important enough.</p>
<p>Rule 7: Don’t work on only the big stuff. There’s a lot of smaller stuff you need to do at any point in time, like responding to email. Don’t let it build up. You have to devote some of each day to keeping that stuff under control.</p>
<p>Rule 8: Think about the minimum you can do in order to complete a task. Do you really need to type out a long email, or can you provide a summary and add a link to the same information on a website? Do you need to meet with all four people individually, or can you meet with one and work with that information?</p>
<p>Rule 9: Organization is nice, but nobody pays you to be organized. Don’t worry about having an elaborate system with all required information at your fingertips. Spend as little time on your task list as possible. The important thing is to decide what you’re going to do and how you’re going to do it, and then actually do it. A non-functional system means you’re doing a lot of things you shouldn’t, not doing things you should, and feeling stress because of failure and chaos. If you’re not experiencing those feelings, your task list is working.</p>
