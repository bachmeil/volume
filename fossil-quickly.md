# How Fast Can You Start A Journal?

Fossil makes it easy to write a journal. Not only can you add new posts quickly, but it renders everything for you, gives you a website, and provides version control.

How fast can you get this system running? Assuming Fossil is installed, go to an empty directory, and type

```
fossil new reponame
```

where reponame is the name of your Fossil repo. Then open the repo

```
fossil open reponame
fossil ui
```

Go to the wiki menu item and create a new post. That's it. Yep, it's pretty darn easy!
