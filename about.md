# About This Site

It's my belief that it's important to write for others on a regular basis. Not tweets and Facebook posts, but real writing. And not a journal. A journal is written for yourself. You write differently when you're writing something others might read.

This site is not intended for consumption by others, but by making it publicly available, I know it's *possible* that somebody will read *something* I've put here. One of the things professors tell their students all the time is that they know they're not ready for the exam if they can't explain the material to someone else. The same principle applies when you're writing for a public audience. You explain things differently, in many ways better, when you're not the only one that's going to read what you've written. You can't get away with being lazy.

My job keeps me plenty busy. I don't have enough time for writing during the day. This site is my place to write about anything I want. The content is boring by design. There's no theme, no reason I choose to write about these things. If it's on my mind (usually because I'm reading about that topic) then I'll put it here.

The goal is volume. I want to write as much as possible for a public audience, even though the public audience is quite small. Production of interesting content is not the goal. I mean, sure, it's possible something might accidentally be interesting, but that's not something I'm striving for.

I recommend that you take this challenge. Try to write as great a volume as you can, without writing anything you wouldn't want others to read.
