<h1 id="static-site-generation">Static site generation</h1>
<p>There are approximately a bazillion static site generators floating around. This post is what I’d like in a static site generator.</p>
<p>1. Support for Pandoc. That lets me write in any format I want. I’m not the biggest fan of markdown. I use it because it’s what’s most supported and it sort of works.</p>
<p>2. No restrictions on file names. I don’t like having to, for instance, include the date in the file name. What if it gets updated? What if I have multiple posts on the same day?</p>
<p>3. Good theme. That means customization is easy.</p>
<p>4. Support for equations.</p>
<p>5. Put the title in the first line of a post, like this: <code>title: Why dogs eat yellow snow</code>.</p>
<p>6. Index creation using the title of each post.</p>
<p>7. Tag support.</p>
<p>8. Rebuilding only the new/changed input files or recently changed files.</p>
<p>The remaining question is the ordering of the posts in the index. I <em>think</em> the answer is to have a post creation command that puts a timestamp (including seconds) on the second line. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>title:
created: 2020-02-19 21:15:02</code></pre>
<p>Maybe even allow the title to be an argument to the call.</p>
