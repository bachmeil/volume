<h1 id="successful-writing">Successful writing</h1>
<p>I’ve been making observations about “successful” writing (meaning writing that gets lots of attention) for a while now. One of the most surprising things is the lack of anything special about the writing. Typically, the author will start out with a pretty common observation. To make this independent of any writing I’ve read recently, you might read a blog post about things people do at the bank. They observe that people often look nervous at the bank, and they write about why that might be the case. They even throw some of their own experiences in - “I once asked a little old lady why she looked nervous, and she said it was because her house was in foreclosure. Otherwise she wouldn’t have had any reason to go to the bank.” The astute reader will note that this observation is recursive, because it applies to what I’m doing here, though admittedly this post will not get a lot of attention.</p>
<p>The way I view successful writing in 2020 is that it’s like posting in a forum. You might say something really dumb, but if your goal is to maximize the number of replies, that’s usually a good thing. If you write something really deep, something that demonstrates how well you know the topic, nobody else will have an opinion and nobody will comment. They treat it like an encyclopedia. Nobody comments on encyclopedia articles except to point out technical errors. That’s not good if you want people reading your stuff. If you write something that (a) hits on a topic others find interesting, (b) others think they understand, and (c) looks like a regular person of questionable intelligence wrote, then they’ll read it and engage. What you wrote is a good conversation starter, but everybody else wants to take the discussion to a deeper level, and they think they can do it.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I want to be writing things like that. I kind of like writing reference material rather than starting forum threads. But if I do decide I want to write popular things, I have a pretty good idea what writing strategy I’ll employ.</p>
